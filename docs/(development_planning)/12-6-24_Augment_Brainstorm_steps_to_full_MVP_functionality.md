# Augment Chat 12-6-24: Brainstorm Steps to Full MVP Functionality

## You

Right now, our application is functional, but contains boilerplate code and functionality from a Vercel template titled "AI Chatbot." Our goal for the application, our startup's MVP, is to use the current codebase as a foundation for building an educational platform that uses a chat interface to serve educational content written by experts to students. Educational content will be broken down into ContentChunks stored on a postgres database. We then want to draw on AI APIs to transform the content served by (1) modifying the undergraduate-level content to the reading level of the individual user, and (2) modifying instruction to match the background (e.g. undergraduate major, geographic location, etc.) and future career of the user. 

I'd like you to help me add the unique features to the codebase required to launch our MVP. Let's focus first on modifying what happens when a user launces the app. Rather than waiting for user input, we'd like the app to deliver a series of introductory content chunks.

Brainstorm what alterations to the current codebase we need to design and implement to bring planned functionalities to the application.

## Augment

Certainly! Let's brainstorm the alterations needed to transform the current AI Chatbot template into your educational platform MVP. We'll focus on modifying the app launch experience to deliver introductory content chunks. Here's a breakdown of the key changes and additions we need to make:

### Database Schema Updates

- Create a new ContentChunk table in the database to store educational content.
- Add fields for module_id, chunk_id, content, type (e.g., introduction, lesson, check-in), reading_level, and metadata (for background and career customization).

### Content Management

- Develop an admin interface or API endpoints for experts to input and manage educational content chunks.
- Implement a system to organize content into modules and sequences.

### User Profile

- Extend the user schema to include fields for reading level, background (major, location), and career goals.
- Create a user onboarding flow to collect this information.

### Initial Content Delivery

- Modify the app/(chat)/page.tsx to fetch initial content chunks instead of starting with an empty chat.
- Implement a function to retrieve the appropriate introductory content chunks based on the user's profile.

### AI Integration for Content Customization

- Develop middleware to interact with AI APIs for content transformation.
- Implement functions to adjust content based on user's reading level and background.

### Chat Interface Modifications

- Update the Chat component to handle both pre-loaded content chunks and user interactions.
- Implement a system to progress through content chunks based on user engagement.

### Content Progression Logic

- Develop logic to determine when to serve the next content chunk or when to pause for user input.
- Implement a "check-in" system to assess user understanding and adjust content delivery accordingly.

### API Route Updates

- Create new API routes for fetching and progressing through content chunks.
- Modify existing chat routes to incorporate educational content flow.

### State Management

- Implement state management (e.g., using React Context or Redux) to keep track of the user's progress through the educational content.

### User Interface Enhancements

Design and implement UI components for displaying educational content in a more structured manner.
Add progress indicators and navigation controls for moving through content.

### Testing and Evaluation

- Develop a system to track user engagement and progress.
- Implement analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of content and AI-driven customizations.

To start implementing these changes, let's focus on the most critical components for the MVP:

- Define the ContentChunk schema and create the database table.
- Implement basic content management functionality.
- Modify the app launch experience to fetch and display initial content chunks.
- Update the chat interface to handle pre-loaded content and basic progression.

Would you like me to provide more detailed implementation steps for any of these initial components?
